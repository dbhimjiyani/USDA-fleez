Aloha,

My name is Devanshi and I am working with the USDA in Hawai`i (in collaboration with the scientists at the University of Hawai`i at Manoa) to build 
an image recognition and prediction model for recognizing fruitfly species.
This project is intended to be an open source research software, and we hope that with it, recognizing pest fruit fly species that are wreaking 
absolute havoc on island crops would be easier. The need for this software being that the pest species are phenotypically verrryyy similar to 
sister species that are local. We are hoping to build this software so that even if you aren't a biologist with a glittering PhD, should you  
need to check the species of a fruitfly, all you would have to do is tear off the wings (sadface) and stick it under clearn tape and a microscope 
(if can) and just scan a picture on your phone and the app could tell if you should warn your local Ag dept. a new potential threat to the flora 
of your area's ecosystem. Pretty neat stuff.
  
More info. about the software to come later!

Mahalo and please feel free to contact me at devanshi.bhimjiyani@gmail.com if you have any questions/suggestions!


Sincerely,
Devanshi
